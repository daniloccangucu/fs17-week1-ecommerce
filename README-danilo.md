# About Me

Hello there! 👋 I'm Danilo, your colleague (or student) in Integrify. Here's a bit about who I am:

## 🎭🖥️ Background

Hey there! 👋 I come from a rich cultural background in theater, photography, and audiovisual arts. Surprisingly, I've delved into programming for the past two years, blending creativity with code. Whether on stage or in pixels, I thrive on embracing new challenges. 🚀✨

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

Currently, wrapping up my studies in Information and Communication Technology at Ålands yrkesgymnasium. Proficient in React, Redux, Material UI, JavaScript, Java, Spring, Go, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, SQL, SQLite, and Node.js. Eager to make a positive impact in the tech realm. 🌐💻

## 🌈 Fun Facts

- In my free time, you'll often find me at the movie theater, where I've already enjoyed more than 10 screenings this year.
- I'm a dedicated music enthusiast, and according to the latest Spotify's wrap, I proudly belong to the less than 1% of people who listen to more music globally.
- I live by the belief that a well-curated playlist or a captivating movie can transform any moment. 🎬🎶

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀✨
